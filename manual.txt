If filename is specified on command line, it is loaded as initial 
state (instead of constructing one). Mandatory for 
lsnes-avidump.exe and movieinfo.exe.

2.4 Misc. options

2.4.1 --run=<file> (lsnes.exe only)

After running main RC file, run this file. If multiple are 
specified, these execute in order specified.

3 Startup file lsnes.rc

Upon startup, lsnes (lsnes.exe only) executes file lsnes.rc as 
commands. This file is located in:

• Windows: %APPDATA%\lsnes\lsnes.rc (if %APPDATA% exists)

• Unix: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lsnes/lsnes.rc (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME 
  exists)

• Unix: $HOME/.config/lsnes/lsnes.rc (if $HOME exists)

• All: ./lsnes.rc (fallback default).

If leading directories do not exist, attempt to create them is 
made.

4 Game internal commands

• Commands beginning with '*' invoke the corresponding command 
  without alias expansion.

• If command starts with '+' (after possible '*'), the command is 
  executed as-is when button is pressed, and when button is 
  released, it is executed with '+' replaced by '-'.

4.1 Settings:

Settings control various aspects of emulator behaviour.

4.1.1 set-setting <setting> <value>

Sets setting <setting> to value <value> (may be empty).

4.1.2 unset-setting <setting>

4.2 Keybindings

Keybindings bind commands or aliases to keys (or pseudo-keys). 

Notes:

• Do not bind edge active (+/-) commands to keys with modifiers, 
  that won't work right!

• Names of keys and modifiers are platform-dependent.

• Be careful before binding pseudo-keys (such as joystick axes, 
  buttons or hats) with modifiers. That may or may not work 
  right.

4.2.1 bind-key [<mod>/<modmask>] <key> <command>

Bind <command> to key <key> (activating if modifiers in <modmask> 
(comma-seperated list) are set as <mod> (comma-seperated list).

The names of keys and modifiers are platform-dependent.

4.2.2 unbind-key [<mod>/<modmask>] <key>

Unbind command from <key> (with specified <mod> and <modmask>).

4.2.3 set-axis <axis> [disabled | axis | axis-inverse | 
  pressure0- | pressure0+ | pressure-0 | pressure-+ | pressure+0 
  | pressure+-] [minus=<val>] [zero=<val>] [plus=<val>] 
  [tolerance=<val>]

Set axis parameters for axis <axis>.

• disabled: Disable axis

• axis: Normal axis

• axis-inverse: Inverse axis

• pressure0-: Pressure sensitive. Released at 0, pressed at -.

• pressure0+: Pressure sensitive. Released at 0, pressed at +.

• pressure-0: Pressure sensitive. Released at -, pressed at 0.

• pressure-+: Pressure sensitive. Released at -, pressed at +.

• pressure+0: Pressure sensitive. Released at +, pressed at 0.

• pressure+-: Pressure sensitive. Released at +, pressed at -.

• minus=<val>: Calibration at extreme minus position 
  (-32768-32767)

• zero=<val>: Calibration at neutral position (-32768-32767)

• plus=<val>: Calibration at extreme plus position (-32768-32767)

• tolerance=<value>: Center band tolerance (0<x<1). The smaller 
  the value, the more sensitive the control is.

4.2.4 show-bindings

Print all key bindings in effect.

4.3 Aliases

Aliases bind command to sequence of commands. After alias has 
been defined, it replaces the command it shadows.

Notes:

• You can't alias command to itself.

• Aliases starting with +/- are edge active just like ordinary 
  commands starting with +/-.

• One command can be aliased to multiple commands.

4.3.1 alias-command <command> <expansion>

Append <expansion> to alias <command>. If alias does not already 
exist, it is created.

4.3.2 unalias-command <command>

Clear alias expansion for <command>.

• The codec is Camstudio Codec in gzip mode.

• Encoder and muxer are internal, available on all platforms.

• Audio enable/disable and framerate has no effect.

• Levels 10-18 are not compatible with AVISource.

• Recomended level is 7 if decoded by AVISource.

• Recomended level is 16 if decoded by ffmpeg, mencoder or 
  FFMpegSource.

• Dumps of low-res PAL games are 256x239 (with all the 
  consequences odd height carries).

• The audio dumped to .avi is low-quality version. The 
  high-quality version is dumped to .sox file.

4.5.2 end-avi

End current AVI video dump (closing the emulator also closes the 
dump).

4.6 JMD video dumping

Following commands control JMD video dumping:

4.6.1 dump-jmd <file>

Dump JMD video to file <file>.

4.6.2 end-jmd

4.7 Memory manipulation

<address> may be decimal or hexadecimal (prefixed with '0x'). 
<value> can be hexadecimal (prefixed with '0x'), unsigned or 
signed (prefixed with '-') decimal.

The available element <sizes> are:

• byte: 1 byte

• word: 2 bytes

• dword: 4 bytes

• qword: 8 bytes

When reading RAM and ROM, multi-byte reads/writes are big-endian. 
When dealing with DSP memory, multi-byte reads/writes are 
native-endian (do not use operand sizes exceeding DSP bitness, 
except dword is OK for 24-bit memory).

• s: signed

<sizeflag> can be:

• b: byte

• w: word

• d: dword

• q: qword

<op> can be:

• lt: < previous value.

Called when video dump frame is being painted. Any gui.* calls 
requiring graphic context draw on the video.

6.10.3 Callback: on_frame()

Called on each starting whole frame.

6.10.4 Callback: on_startup()

Called when the emulator is starting (lsnes.rc and --run files 
has been run).

6.10.5 Callback: on_pre_load(string name)

Called just before savestate/movie load occurs (note: loads are 
always delayed, so this occurs even when load was initiated by 
lua).

6.10.6 Callback: on_err_load(string name)

Called if loadstate goes wrong.

6.10.7 Callback: on_post_load(string name, boolean was_savestate)

Called on successful loadstate. was_savestate gives if this was a 
savestate or a movie.

6.10.8 Callback: on_pre_save(string name, boolean is_savestate)

Called just before savestate save occurs (note: movie saves are 
synchronous and won't trigger these callbacks if called from 
Lua).

6.10.9 Callback: on_err_save(string name)

Called if savestate goes wrong.

6.10.10 Callback: on_post_save(string name, boolean is_savestate)

Called on successful savaestate. is_savestate gives if this was a 
savestate or a movie.

6.10.11 Callback: on_quit()

Called when emulator is shutting down.

6.10.12 Callback: on_input(boolean subframe)

Called when emulator is just sending input to bsnes core.

are ignored.

6.10.13 Callback: on_reset()

Called when SNES is reset.

6.10.14 Callback: on_readwrite()

Called when moving into readwrite mode as result of “set-rwmode” 
command (note: moving to rwmode by Lua won't trigger this, as per 
recursive entry protection).

6.10.15 Callback: on_snoop(number port, number controller, number 
  index, number value)

Called each time bsnes asks for input. The value is the final 
value to be sent to bsnes core (readonly mode, autohold and 
autofire have been taken into account). Might be useful when 
translating movies to format suitable for console verification. 
Note: There is no way to modify the value to be sent.

  consequtive IDs.

• IDs are interpretted as 256-bit big-endian integers with 
  warparound.

• Initial predicted ID is all zeroes.

Format of each record is:

• 1 byte: Opcode byte. Bits 0-4 are prefix length (prefixlen), 
  bits 5-6 are count length (countlen). Bit 7 is unused.

• 32-prefixlen bytes of ID.

• countlen bytes of big-endian count (count).

Records are processed as follows:

• To form the first ID encoded by record, take the first 
  prefixlen bytes predicted ID and append the read ID value to 
  it. The result is the first ID encoded.

• If countlen is 0, record encodes 1 ID.

• If countlen is 1, record encodes 2+count IDs.

• If countlen is 2, record encodes 258+count IDs.

• If countlen is 3, record encodes 65794+count IDs.

• The new predicted ID is the next ID after last one encoded by 
  the record.

The number of rerecords + 1 is equal to the sum of number of IDs 
encoded by all records.

9 Compiling:

9.1 Building BSNES

make ui=ui-libsnes profile=accuracy

For Bsnes v084 You need to apply the six patches in 
bsnes-patches/. These fix the following:

1. Make libsnes actually compile (it won't compile without!)

2. Bump the version number to be correct (nice to have)

3. Make RTC emulation time cleanly overridable (needed by games 
  using RTC)

4. Save/Load controller state on savestate/loadstate (many games 
  screw up without)

5. Fix unserialization of 64-bit integers (needed)

6. Allow frontend to control random number seed (just nice to 
  have)

9.2 Prerequisite libraries:

• zlib

• SDL (SDL platform)

• SDLmain (Windows/Mac OS X only; Note you may have to extract 
  the object out of archive)

• boost_iostreams

• boost_filesystem

• boost conversion (header only)

Prepend this to all commands refering to cross-compiling 
environment with this.

9.3.5 CC=<compiler>

Target C++ compiler to use. Defaults to g++

Note: If crosscompiling, this has to be crosscompiler, and 
CROSS_PREFIX is prepended.

9.3.6 BSNES_IS_COMPAT=1

Assume BSNES uses compatiblity core instead of accuracy core.

9.3.7 LUA=<package>

Compile lua support, using package <package>

9.3.8 GRAPHICS=<plat>

Set graphics platform. Currently available choices are “SDL” and “
WXWIDGETS”.

10 Quick'n'dirty encode guide

1. Start the emulator and load the movie file.

2. Set large AVI option 'set-setting avi-large on'

3. Enable dumping 'dump-avi tmpdump' 

4. Unpause and let it run until you want to end dumping.

5. Close the emulator (closing the window is the easiest way). Or 
  use 'end-avi'.

6. For each tmpdump*.avi file created, on command prompt, do 
  'x264 --crf 10 -o tmpdump_<numbers>.mkv tmpdump_<numbers>.avi'.

7. Do 'sox tmpdump.sox tmpdump.ogg rate -v 32000'

8. Do 'mkvmerge -o tmpdump_video.mkv tmpdump_0000000.mkv + 
  tmpdump_0000001.mkv + tmpdump_0000002.mkv' (list every 
  tmpdump_<numbers>.mkv, with + in between).

9. Do 'mkvmerge -o final.mkv tmpdump_video.mkv tmpdump.ogg'. Now 
  final.mkv contains quick'n'dirty encode.

12 Errata:

12.1 Problems from BSNES core:

• The whole pending save stuff.

• Lack of layer hiding.

• It is slow.

• Firmwares can't be loaded from ZIP archives.

12.2 Other problems:

• Modifiers don't work with pseudo-keys (SDL, EVDEV).

• Audio for last dumped frame is not itself dumped.

• Audio in UI is pretty bad in quality.

• UI itself is 30fps max (SDL).

• AVI compression levels 10-18 are not compatible with AVISynth 
  AVISource.

• No menus, command based interface (SDL).

• Long commands don't scroll.

• The SDL screen drawing is slow.

• Wxwidgets UI slows down with time.

• Movies use way too much (like at least 10x what would be 
  needed) memory.
